# transfer-learning

# 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
#    - Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
#    - Visualizes sample images, the class distribution, and the mean and standard deviation of pixel values.
#    - Performs data augmentation using techniques like rotation, shifting, and flipping to increase training data variability.
#    - Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1].
#    - Converts labels to one-hot encoding for use with the models.

# 2. Model Building and Training:
#    - Utilizes the VGG16 and VGG19 architectures, which are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
#    - Loads the pre-trained models without the top classification layers.
#    - Freezes most of the layers initially to avoid destroying pre-trained weights during the initial stages of training.
#    - Adds custom classification layers on top of the base models (Flatten, Dense, Dropout).
#    - Compiles the models with an Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
#    - Trains both models for a specified number of epochs using the training data, while monitoring performance on the validation data.
#    - Plots the training and validation accuracy, loss, precision, and recall to analyze the models' learning progress.

# 3. Model Evaluation and Visualization:
#    - Selects random images from the test set.
#    - Uses the trained models to predict the classes of these images.
#    - Visualizes the selected images along with their predicted and true labels.

# In essence, the code demonstrates how to leverage transfer learning (using pre-trained VGG models) to build and train image classification models for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
# It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model construction, training, and evaluation steps.
